Artificial Intelligence project consisting in building a robust heart beat classifier, capable of distinguish between regular, ventricular and supraventricular beats, basing on the ECG of the patient.

The full explanation of the project procedures and techniques adopted can be found in Report.pdf

The python notebook file contains a step by step statistical analysis of the dataset we were given and the code to build the classifiers.
